excerpt: "Our project proposes to use Virtual Reality (VR) to train chemists to react to incidents. It explores the effects of multisensoriality on learner VR sense of presence and immersion, and the effects of visualising (in/out of VR) behavioural and physiological indicators on learner reflexivity. Multisensoriality implementation, robust capture of behavioural and physiological data, and the design of relevant indicators are our main challenges. Three situations involving chemical incidents have been developed, engaging the learner to react accordingly. We present the first implementations of this VR training environment and the results of our first user studies."
